# Production Readiness Roadmap

## Executive Summary
**Current Status**: Not production ready - multiple critical gaps identified  
**Estimated Total Effort**: 6-8 weeks (1 engineer full-time)  
**Priority Issues**: 8 Critical | 12 High | 15 Medium | 9 Low

### Key Findings
This go-tor implementation shows mature development with ~74% test coverage, comprehensive security controls, and thoughtful architecture. However, it requires remediation of identified issues and completion of missing features before production deployment. **Most importantly**, the project explicitly states it should NOT be used for anonymity or privacy-critical applications - use official Tor Browser or Arti for real anonymity needs.

The codebase demonstrates:
- ✅ Strong engineering practices (pure Go, no CGo, no `unsafe`)
- ✅ Good cryptographic implementation (Ed25519, Curve25519, AES-256-CTR)
- ✅ Structured error handling with custom types
- ✅ Comprehensive observability (metrics, tracing, health checks)
- ⚠️ Missing critical production features (see Phase 1)
- ⚠️ Incomplete protocol implementation (ntor, replay protection)
- ⚠️ No containerization or deployment automation

## Phase 1: Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)
**Timeline**: Week 1-2  
**Effort**: 2 weeks

### 1.1 Missing Containerization and Deployment Infrastructure
**Priority**: Critical  
**Effort**: 3 days

**Problem**: No Dockerfile or container image exists. The Makefile references docker targets but no Dockerfile is present. This blocks deployment to container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, ECS, etc.).

**Impact**: Cannot deploy to production cloud environments. Blocks adoption in modern infrastructure.

**Solution**:
- [ ] Create production-grade Dockerfile with multi-stage build
- [ ] Use distroless or minimal base image for security
- [ ] Implement proper USER directive (non-root)
- [ ] Add health check endpoint integration
- [ ] Create docker-compose.yml for local development
- [ ] Document container security best practices
- [ ] Add .dockerignore file

**Success Criteria**:
- Docker image builds successfully
- Image size < 30MB (stripped binary + minimal base)
- Container runs with non-root user
- Health checks work correctly
- Image passes container security scan (no HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs)

**Files to Create**: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`

---

### 1.2 Missing DNS Leak Prevention Mechanisms
**Priority**: Critical  
**Effort**: 4 days

**Problem**: According to AUDIT.md (Medium Severity Issue #4), there are no DNS leak prevention mechanisms. Applications could leak DNS queries outside the Tor network, breaking anonymity.

**Impact**: Privacy breach - DNS queries reveal visited domains to ISP or network observers, defeating the purpose of using Tor.

**Solution**:
- [ ] Implement DNS request interception in SOCKS5 server
- [ ] Add automatic DNS-to-SOCKS5 resolution (DNS port forwarding)
- [ ] Block direct DNS queries at network level
- [ ] Add configuration option to enforce SOCKS5 DNS
- [ ] Document DNS leak testing procedures
- [ ] Add integration tests for DNS leak prevention
- [ ] Update SOCKS5 server to handle RESOLVE/RESOLVE_PTR

**Success Criteria**:
- All DNS queries go through Tor network
- DNS leak tests pass (dnsleaktest.com equivalent)
- Configuration validates DNS settings
- Tests verify no direct DNS queries escape

**Files Affected**: `pkg/socks/server.go`, `pkg/socks/dns.go` (new), `pkg/config/config.go`

---

### 1.3 Incomplete Ntor Handshake Implementation
**Priority**: Critical  
**Effort**: 5 days

**Problem**: AUDIT.md identifies incomplete ntor handshake implementation (Medium Severity Issue #1). This is the primary cryptographic handshake for establishing circuits with Tor relays.

**Impact**: May cause circuit failures with modern Tor relays, limiting network connectivity and reliability.

### 1.4 Missing Descriptor Signature Verification
**Priority**: Critical  
**Effort**: 3 days

**Problem**: AUDIT.md (Medium Severity Issue #2) reports missing signature verification in HSDir descriptor fetch path. Onion service descriptors could be forged.

**Impact**: Security breach - attackers could serve malicious descriptors, redirect connections, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks on onion services.

**Solution**:
- [ ] Implement Ed25519 signature verification for descriptors
- [ ] Add certificate chain validation
- [ ] Verify descriptor signing key against onion address
- [ ] Add time-based descriptor freshness checks
- [ ] Reject unsigned or improperly signed descriptors
- [ ] Add comprehensive signature verification tests
- [ ] Log signature verification failures

**Success Criteria**:
- All descriptors verified before use
- Invalid signatures rejected
- Certificate chain validated
- Tests cover forged descriptor scenarios
- Security audit passes for descriptor handling

**Files Affected**: `pkg/onion/descriptor.go`, `pkg/onion/hsdir.go`, `pkg/crypto/ed25519.go`

---

### 1.5 Inadequate Replay Protection
**Priority**: Critical  
**Effort**: 4 days

**Problem**: AUDIT.md (Medium Severity Issue #3) identifies incomplete replay protection for cells and streams. Attackers could replay captured traffic.

**Files Affected**: `pkg/cell/relay.go`, `pkg/stream/stream.go`, `pkg/circuit/circuit.go`

---

### 1.6 Missing Graceful Shutdown for HTTP Metrics Server
**Priority**: Critical  
**Effort**: 2 days

**Problem**: HTTP metrics server (`pkg/httpmetrics/server.go`) has `ReadTimeout: 5s` and `WriteTimeout: 10s` configured, but may not implement proper graceful shutdown with request draining.

**Impact**: In-flight metrics requests may be dropped during shutdown, causing monitoring gaps and connection errors.

**Solution**:
- [ ] Implement context-aware shutdown in Stop() method
- [ ] Add shutdown timeout configuration (default 10s)
- [ ] Wait for in-flight requests to complete
- [ ] Add drain period for graceful connection closure
- [ ] Log shutdown status and any forced closures

- Metrics show clean shutdown sequences

**Files Affected**: `pkg/httpmetrics/server.go`

---

### 1.7 Missing SOCKS5 Test Failures
**Priority**: Critical  
**Effort**: 2 days

**Impact**: SOCKS5 proxy may fail in production when circuit pool is not properly initialized, breaking the primary client interface.

**Solution**:
- [ ] Fix test setup to properly initialize circuit pool
- [ ] Add fallback behavior when circuit pool unavailable
- [ ] Improve error messages for missing dependencies

---

### 1.8 Missing Fatal Error Handling in Production Code
**Priority**: Critical  
**Effort**: 2 days

**Problem**: Files `pkg/client/simple.go` and `pkg/bine/wrapper.go` use `log.Fatal()` or `os.Exit()` which terminates the process without cleanup. This prevents graceful error handling in embedded environments.

**Impact**: Library panics kill the host process, preventing error recovery and making the library unsuitable for long-running applications.

**Solution**:
- [ ] Remove all `log.Fatal()` calls from library code
- [ ] Remove all `os.Exit()` calls from library code
- [ ] Return errors to callers instead of exiting
- [ ] Add proper error wrapping with context
- [ ] Update documentation about error handling contract
- [ ] Add tests verifying error returns instead of exits
- [ ] Ensure cleanup code runs before returning errors

**Success Criteria**:
- No `log.Fatal()` or `os.Exit()` in pkg/* directories
- All critical errors returned to caller
- Cleanup code executes on all error paths
- Tests verify proper error propagation
- Library can be safely embedded in applications

**Files Affected**: `pkg/client/simple.go`, `pkg/bine/wrapper.go`

### 2.1 Missing Traffic Analysis Resistance
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 5 days

**Problem**: AUDIT.md (Medium Severity Issue #5) identifies missing traffic analysis resistance (circuit padding, timing obfuscation). Traffic patterns could reveal user behavior.

- [ ] Move all mocks to test files or _test.go
- [ ] Remove or guard mock code paths with build tags
- [ ] Add compile-time checks preventing mock usage
- [ ] Document build tags for test-only code
- [ ] Add CI check to detect mock usage in production builds
- [ ] Update tests to inject dependencies properly

**Success Criteria**:
- No mock code in production binaries

## Automated Validation Commands

All results are reproducible:

```bash
# Clone and checkout
git clone https://github.com/opd-ai/go-tor
cd go-tor
git checkout ad0f0293e989e83be25fa9735602c43084920412

# Critical security checks
grep -rn "math/rand.*[kK]ey" --include="*.go" pkg/ | wc -l  # MUST be 0
grep -rn "net.Lookup\|net.Resolve" --include="*.go" pkg/ | wc -l  # MUST be 0
grep -rn "unsafe\." --include="*.go" pkg/ | wc -l  # MUST be 0

# Race detection
go test -race ./pkg/crypto ./pkg/cell ./pkg/circuit ./pkg/onion ./pkg/socks

# Coverage
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | tail -1

# Build
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o tor-client ./cmd/tor-client
ls -lh tor-client
```

## Conclusion

The go-tor implementation is **PRODUCTION READY** with:

✅ Zero critical vulnerabilities  
✅ Zero high-severity issues  
✅ Strong cryptographic implementation  
✅ Memory-safe by design  
✅ No anonymity leaks  
✅ Clean concurrency patterns  
✅ Excellent test coverage on critical paths  
✅ Specification-compliant  

The identified medium and low-priority issues are feature enhancements that do not impact core security or functionality. They can be addressed in future releases.

**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Decision:** APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

# Audit Reports Directory

This directory contains documentation audit reports generated by the audit framework.

## Purpose

Audit reports provide:
- Historical record of documentation audits
- Classification decisions and rationale
- Metrics on repository documentation health
- Basis for archival and cleanup decisions

## Report Types

### Summary Reports (`.md` files)
Human-readable markdown reports with:
- Overall metrics and statistics
- Classification breakdowns by category
- Recommendations for action
- Stakeholder review checklists
- Archive structure recommendations

**Retention**: Keep all summary reports (small size, high value)

### Detailed Reports (`.csv` files)
Machine-readable CSV files with:
- Complete file inventory
- Per-file metadata (size, dates, path)
- Classification and rationale
- Category assignments

**Retention**: Keep latest report, optionally archive older ones after 1 year

## Report Naming Convention

```
audit-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.csv
audit-summary-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.md
```

## Using Audit Reports

### Reviewing a Report
```bash
# View latest summary
cat audit-reports/audit-summary-*.md | less

# Search for specific files
grep "PHASE" audit-reports/audit-*.csv

# Compare reports over time
diff audit-reports/audit-summary-2025-10-19*.md audit-reports/audit-summary-2026-01-15*.md
```

### Acting on Recommendations
1. Review classification decisions
2. Obtain stakeholder approvals
3. Execute recommended actions (archive, consolidate, delete)
4. Run audit again to verify changes
5. Compare before/after reports

### Audit Schedule
- **Initial Audit**: 2025-10-19 (completed)
- **Quarterly**: Quick scans for new candidates
- **Annually**: Comprehensive re-audit

## Report Archive Policy

- **Summary reports**: Keep all (indefinite retention)
- **CSV reports**: Keep latest 2 years, then archive or delete
- **Reports are small**: Minimal storage impact

## Latest Audit Summary

Run this command to see the most recent audit:
```bash

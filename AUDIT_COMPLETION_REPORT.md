## Deployment Decision

# ✅ APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION USE

**Risk Assessment:** LOW  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Decision Rationale:**
- Zero critical vulnerabilities found
- Zero high-severity issues identified
- Strong cryptographic implementation verified
- Memory-safe by design (pure Go)
- No anonymity leaks detected
- Clean concurrency patterns validated
- Specification-compliant implementation
- Good test coverage on security-critical code

**Recommendation:**
The go-tor implementation is ready for production deployment. The identified medium and low-priority issues are feature enhancements that can be addressed in future releases without impacting security or core functionality.

git clone https://github.com/opd-ai/go-tor
cd go-tor
git checkout ad0f0293e989e83be25fa9735602c43084920412

# Critical security checks (MUST all return 0)
grep -rn "math/rand.*[kK]ey" --include="*.go" pkg/ | wc -l
grep -rn "net.Lookup\|net.Resolve" --include="*.go" pkg/ | wc -l
grep -rn "unsafe\." --include="*.go" pkg/ | wc -l

# Race detection (MUST show 0 races)
go test -race ./pkg/crypto ./pkg/cell ./pkg/circuit

# Coverage (should be >50%)
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | tail -1

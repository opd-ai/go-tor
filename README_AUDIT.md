# Security Audit Documentation

This directory contains the comprehensive security audit of the go-tor pure Go Tor client implementation.

## Primary Deliverable

**ðŸ“„ AUDIT_COMPREHENSIVE.md** (692 lines)
- **Purpose:** Complete zero-defect security audit per specification
- **Date:** 2025-10-20
- **Commit Audited:** b51c1cf79c004adff881c939d3e4eb53f7649c06
- **Scope:** Full implementation (26K LOC, 21 packages)

## Quick Summary

### Risk Assessment
**Overall Risk:** HIGH  
**Recommendation:** FIX CRITICAL AND HIGH ISSUES BEFORE PRODUCTION

### Critical Findings
1. **CRYPTO-001 (HIGH):** Missing relay cell digest verification - enables cell injection attacks
2. **RACE-001 (CRITICAL):** Test code race condition
3. **PROTO-001 (HIGH):** Circuit padding incomplete
4. **PROTO-002 (HIGH):** INTRODUCE1 encryption missing

### Key Strengths âœ“
- âœ… Memory-safe by design (0 unsafe usage)
- âœ… Cryptographically sound (crypto/rand only)
- âœ… No DNS/IP leaks
- âœ… Excellent embedded fit (8.8MB, <50MB RAM)
- âœ… 74% test coverage
- âœ… Clean architecture

### Remediation Timeline
- **CRITICAL + HIGH:** 58-114 hours (1-2 weeks)
- **Full production readiness:** 90-174 hours (2-3 weeks)

- âœ… Security threat modeling

### Areas Audited
- âœ… Specification compliance (tor-spec.txt, rend-spec-v3.txt, etc.)
- âœ… Feature parity with C Tor
- âœ… Cryptographic implementations
- âœ… Memory safety (100% coverage)
- âœ… Concurrency safety (race detection)
- âœ… Protocol security
- âœ… Privacy & anonymity
- âœ… Embedded systems suitability
- âœ… Code quality & test coverage

## Key Metrics

### Security
- **Unsafe usage:** 0 in production âœ“
- **math/rand usage:** 0 in production âœ“
- **DNS leaks:** 0 âœ“
- **IP leaks:** 0 âœ“
- **Race conditions:** 1 in test code only

### Code Quality
- **Lines of code:** 26,313
- **Test coverage:** 74.0%
- **Packages:** 21
- **Dependencies:** 1 (golang.org/x/crypto)

### Embedded Suitability
- **Binary size:** 8.8MB stripped (<15MB target âœ“)
- **Memory usage:** <50MB (<50MB target âœ“)
- **CPU usage:** Low, suitable for ARM

## How to Read the Audit

1. **Start with AUDIT_COMPREHENSIVE.md** - Executive Summary (page 1)
2. **Review Section 3** - Security Findings (highest priority)
3. **Check Section 6** - Remediation recommendations
4. **See AUDIT_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md** - Quick reference

## Critical Action Items

### Immediate (Before Production)
1. Fix RACE-001 (test code race) - 2 hours
2. **Implement CRYPTO-001** (digest verification) - 8-16 hours - **CRITICAL**
3. Complete PROTO-001 (circuit padding) - 16-24 hours
4. Implement PROTO-002 (INTRODUCE1 encryption) - 16-24 hours
5. Add circuit isolation (GAP-002) - 16-24 hours
6. Implement fuzzing - 16-32 hours

### Follow-up
7. Increase test coverage (protocol, client, crypto)
8. Address MEDIUM severity findings
9. Re-audit after fixes
10. Continuous security monitoring

## Certification

**Status:** Audit Complete  
**Auditor:** Comprehensive Security Assessment Team  
**Confidence:** HIGH (memory/concurrency safety)  
**Date:** 2025-10-20

**Conclusion:** The go-tor implementation has strong foundational security with excellent memory safety, cryptographic soundness, and embedded systems fit. However, the missing relay cell digest verification (CRYPTO-001) is a critical security issue that must be addressed before production deployment. After fixing CRITICAL and HIGH findings, the implementation will be suitable for production use.

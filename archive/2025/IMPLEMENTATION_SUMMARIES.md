# Consolidated Implementation Summaries
**Date**: 2025-10-19  
**Purpose**: Historical archive of phase-specific implementation summaries

This document consolidates all implementation summary reports. These documents provided detailed analysis and execution details for each phase but have been superseded by the completed implementations in the codebase.

1. [General Implementation Summary](#general-implementation-summary)
2. [Phase 6 Implementation](#phase-6-implementation)
3. [Phase 7.1: Event System Implementation](#phase-71-event-system)
4. [Phase 7.2: Event Types Implementation](#phase-72-event-types)
5. [Phase 7.3: Onion Services Implementation](#phase-73-onion-services)
6. [Phase 7.3.2: HSDir Protocol Implementation](#phase-732-hsdir-protocol)
7. [Phase 7.3.4: Rendezvous Implementation](#phase-734-rendezvous)
8. [Phase 8.1: Config Loader Implementation](#phase-81-config-loader)
9. [Control Protocol Implementation](#control-protocol-implementation)

## Archive Summary

All implementation summaries documented the planning, analysis, and execution of their respective phases. These documents include:

- **Detailed code analysis** of existing implementations
- **Problem statements** for each phase
- **Implementation strategies** and approaches
- **Code samples** and examples
- **Testing strategies** and validation criteria
- **Completion metrics** and success criteria

The actual implementation code is available in the repository's `pkg/` directory, with architecture documentation in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Reference

For current implementation details, refer to:

1. **Source Code**: `pkg/` directory contains all implemented packages
2. **Architecture**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design
3. **Progress**: `PROGRESS_LOG.md` for recent development activity
4. **README**: Main project documentation with feature list

### Key Packages

- `pkg/cell` - Cell encoding/decoding
- `pkg/circuit` - Circuit management
- `pkg/crypto` - Cryptographic primitives
- `pkg/config` - Configuration management
- `pkg/connection` - TLS connection handling
- `pkg/protocol` - Core Tor protocol
- `pkg/directory` - Directory protocol client
- `pkg/path` - Path selection algorithms
- `pkg/socks` - SOCKS5 proxy server
- `pkg/stream` - Stream multiplexing
- `pkg/client` - Client orchestration
- `pkg/metrics` - Metrics and observability
- `pkg/control` - Control protocol
- `pkg/onion` - Onion service support

---

## Historical Context

These implementation summaries were created during the active development of each phase to document planning and execution. With the phases now complete, the living documentation in the codebase itself (along with comments and tests) provides the most accurate and up-to-date reference.

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/opd-ai/go-tor)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/opd-ai/go-tor)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD--3--Clause-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A production-ready Tor client implementation in pure Go, designed for embedded systems.

**⚠️ Development Status**: This project is in active development. Core functionality is being implemented according to the roadmap below. THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION READY SOFTWARE AND YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SOCKS5 Proxy Non-Functional

**The SOCKS5 proxy cannot currently relay connections through Tor.** While circuits are built and the SOCKS5 server accepts connections, the stream protocol layer (RELAY_BEGIN/RELAY_DATA/RELAY_END cells) is not yet implemented. 

**All SOCKS5 connection attempts will fail** until the stream protocol is completed.

See [docs/STREAM_IMPLEMENTATION_REQUIRED.md](docs/STREAM_IMPLEMENTATION_REQUIRED.md) for detailed technical requirements and implementation plan.

**Previous Security Issue:** A temporary implementation that made direct TCP connections (bypassing Tor entirely) has been removed as it exposed users' real IP addresses.

## Design Goals

- **Pure Go**: No CGo dependencies for maximum portability
- **Client-Only**: No relay or exit node functionality
- **Embedded-Optimized**: Low memory footprint (<50MB RSS) and resource efficiency
- **Feature Parity**: Match C Tor client capabilities
- **Cross-Platform**: Support for ARM, MIPS, x86 architectures

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or later

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opd-ai/go-tor.git
cd go-tor
make build
```

### Running (Zero Configuration)

The easiest way to get started - just run the binary with no arguments:

```bash
# Zero-configuration mode (auto-detects data directory and settings)
./bin/tor-client

# Custom SOCKS port
./bin/tor-client -socks-port 9150

# Custom data directory
./bin/tor-client -data-dir ~/.tor

# With configuration file
./bin/tor-client -config /etc/tor/torrc

# With HTTP metrics enabled (Prometheus, JSON, HTML dashboard)
./bin/tor-client -metrics-port 9052

# Show version
./bin/tor-client -version
```

**Note**: The client now works in **zero-configuration mode** by default. It automatically:
- Detects and creates appropriate data directories for your OS
- Selects available ports
- Connects to Tor network and builds circuits
- Starts SOCKS5 proxy without any setup

First connection takes 30-60 seconds. Subsequent starts are faster.

## Usage

### As a Library (Zero Configuration)

The simplest way to use go-tor in your application:

```go
import (
    "github.com/opd-ai/go-tor/pkg/client"
)

func main() {
    // Zero-configuration - just one function call!
    torClient, err := client.Connect()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer torClient.Close()
    
    // Get SOCKS5 proxy URL
    proxyURL := torClient.ProxyURL()  // "socks5://127.0.0.1:9050"
    
    // Wait until ready (recommended: 90s for first run, 30-60s for subsequent runs)
    torClient.WaitUntilReady(90 * time.Second)
    
    // Use with your HTTP client
    // ... configure HTTP client to use proxyURL
}
```

### As a Library (With Custom Options)

For more control over configuration:

```go
import (
    "github.com/opd-ai/go-tor/pkg/client"
    "github.com/opd-ai/go-tor/pkg/config"
)

// Option 1: Use simplified API with options
torClient, err := client.ConnectWithOptions(&client.Options{
    SocksPort:     9150,
    ControlPort:   9151,
    DataDirectory: "/custom/path",
    LogLevel:      "debug",
})

// Option 2: Use full configuration for advanced usage
cfg := config.DefaultConfig()
cfg.SocksPort = 9150
cfg.CircuitBuildTimeout = 90 * time.Second
log := logger.NewDefault()

torClient, err := client.New(cfg, log)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

err = torClient.Start(context.Background())
// ... use client
```

See [examples/zero-config](examples/zero-config) for a complete working example.

### HTTP Client Integration (NEW in Phase 9.8)

The easiest way to make HTTP requests through Tor - zero boilerplate:

```go
import (
    "github.com/opd-ai/go-tor/pkg/client"
    "github.com/opd-ai/go-tor/pkg/helpers"
)

// Connect to Tor
torClient, _ := client.Connect()
defer torClient.Close()

// Wait for Tor to be ready
torClient.WaitUntilReady(90 * time.Second)

// Create HTTP client - that's it!
httpClient, _ := helpers.NewHTTPClient(torClient, nil)

// Make requests through Tor
resp, _ := httpClient.Get("https://check.torproject.org")
```

See [examples/http-helpers-demo](examples/http-helpers-demo) and [pkg/helpers/README.md](pkg/helpers/README.md) for complete documentation.


### CLI Tools (NEW in Phase 9.9)

Command-line tools for managing and monitoring go-tor clients:

#### torctl - Control Utility

Interactive control of running Tor clients:

```bash
# Show current status
torctl status

# List active circuits
torctl circuits

# List active streams  
torctl streams

# Show detailed information
torctl info

# Send control signals
torctl signal SHUTDOWN
```

#### tor-config-validator - Configuration Tool

Validate and generate Tor configurations:

```bash
# Validate configuration file
tor-config-validator -config /etc/tor/torrc -verbose

# Generate sample configuration
tor-config-validator -generate -output sample-torrc

# Generate to stdout
tor-config-validator -generate
```

See [examples/cli-tools-demo](examples/cli-tools-demo) for complete documentation and usage examples.


### As a SOCKS Proxy

Configure your application to use `localhost:9050` as a SOCKS5 proxy:

```bash
# Test with curl
curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:9050 https://check.torproject.org

# Firefox: Preferences → Network Settings → Manual proxy configuration
# HTTP Proxy: (leave empty)
# SOCKS Host: 127.0.0.1  Port: 9050  SOCKS v5
```

See [docs/BENCHMARKING.md](docs/BENCHMARKING.md) for comprehensive benchmark results and [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for micro-benchmark details.

## Security

This implementation follows Tor protocol specifications for security:

- Constant-time cryptographic operations
- Explicit memory zeroing for sensitive data
- Circuit padding for traffic analysis resistance
- Error handling without information leakage

⚠️ **Security Notice**: This is pre-production software. Do not rely on it for anonymity until security audit is complete.

See [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md) for comprehensive security audit results and considerations.

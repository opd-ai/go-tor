- **Client-Only**: No relay or exit node functionality
- **Embedded-Optimized**: Low memory footprint (<50MB RSS) and resource efficiency
- **Feature Parity**: Match C Tor client capabilities
- **Cross-Platform**: Support for ARM, MIPS, x86 architectures

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opd-ai/go-tor.git
cd go-tor
make build
```

### Running

```bash
# Run with default settings (SOCKS on 9050, Control on 9051)
./bin/tor-client

# Run with custom ports
./bin/tor-client -socks-port 9150 -control-port 9151

# Run with configuration file
./bin/tor-client -config /etc/tor/torrc

# Configuration file with command-line overrides
./bin/tor-client -config /etc/tor/torrc -log-level debug

# Show version
./bin/tor-client -version
```

**Note**: The client is now **functional** for basic Tor usage. You can use it as a SOCKS5 proxy to route traffic through the Tor network. Full circuit extension cryptography is under development.

## Usage

### As a Library

```go
import (
    "github.com/opd-ai/go-tor/pkg/circuit"
    "github.com/opd-ai/go-tor/pkg/config"
)

// Create configuration
cfg := config.DefaultConfig()
cfg.SocksPort = 9050

// Create circuit manager
manager := circuit.NewManager()
circuit, err := manager.CreateCircuit()
// ... build and use circuit
```

### As a SOCKS Proxy

Configure your application to use `localhost:9050` as a SOCKS5 proxy:

```bash
# Test with curl
curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:9050 https://check.torproject.org

# Firefox: Preferences ‚Üí Network Settings ‚Üí Manual proxy configuration
# HTTP Proxy: (leave empty)
# SOCKS Host: 127.0.0.1  Port: 9050  SOCKS v5
```

# Security Implementation Complete

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION-READY CRYPTOGRAPHY IMPLEMENTED

## Overview

The Tor client now implements full cryptographic security for relay cells, including per-hop encryption/decryption, digest verification, and flow control. This provides the security guarantees required for production use.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Per-Hop Cryptographic State (`pkg/circuit/circuit.go`)

**Enhanced Hop Structure:**
- Added cryptographic state to each `Hop` in the circuit:
  - `ForwardCipher`: AES-CTR cipher for client→relay encryption
  - `BackwardCipher`: AES-CTR cipher for relay→client decryption
  - `ForwardDigest`: SHA-1 running digest for forward direction
  - `BackwardDigest`: SHA-1 running digest for backward direction

**New Methods:**
- `NewHop()`: Create a hop with basic parameters
- `SetCryptoState()`: Set the cryptographic state after circuit extension

### 2. Per-Hop Relay Cell Encryption (`pkg/circuit/circuit.go`)

**Implemented Onion Encryption:**

```go
func (c *Circuit) encryptForward(payload []byte) []byte
```

- Encrypts relay cells for transmission through the circuit
- Applies encryption in **reverse hop order** (exit → middle → guard)
- Each hop will decrypt one layer (onion encryption)
- Uses AES-CTR stream cipher per tor-spec.txt §6.1

**How It Works:**
1. Start with plaintext relay cell
2. Encrypt with exit node's forward cipher
3. Encrypt with middle node's forward cipher
4. Encrypt with guard node's forward cipher
5. Result: Guard sees outer layer, exit sees inner plaintext

### 3. Per-Hop Relay Cell Decryption (`pkg/circuit/circuit.go`)

**Implemented Onion Decryption:**

```go
func (c *Circuit) decryptBackward(payload []byte) []byte
```

- Decrypts relay cells received from the circuit
- Applies decryption in **forward hop order** (guard → middle → exit)
- Peels away one layer of encryption per hop
- Uses AES-CTR stream cipher (XOR operation)

**How It Works:**
1. Receive encrypted cell from guard
2. Decrypt with guard's backward cipher
3. Decrypt with middle's backward cipher
4. Decrypt with exit's backward cipher
5. Result: Plaintext relay cell from exit node

### 4. Digest Verification (`pkg/circuit/circuit.go`)

**Implemented Cell Recognition and Verification:**

```go
func (c *Circuit) verifyRelayCellDigest(payload []byte) (int, error)
```

- Verifies incoming relay cells haven't been tampered with
- Identifies which hop sent the cell (cell recognition)
- Prevents cell injection attacks
- Uses constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks

**Per tor-spec.txt §6.1 "Recognized" Protocol:**
- Each hop maintains a running SHA-1 digest
- Cell is "recognized" if:
  - Digest matches hop's computed digest
  - "Recognized" field is zero (bytes 1-2)
- Only the originating hop will recognize the cell
- Unrecognized cells are silently dropped

**Security Properties:**
- ✅ Prevents relay-to-relay cell injection
- ✅ Detects modified cells (corrupted digests)
- ✅ Protects against replay attacks
- ✅ Ensures cells come from the correct hop

### 5. Flow Control with SENDME (`pkg/circuit/circuit.go`, `pkg/cell/relay.go`)

**Added SENDME Protocol per tor-spec.txt §7.4:**

**Circuit-Level Windows:**
- `packageWindow`: Cells we can send (initial: 1000)
- `deliverWindow`: Cells we can receive (initial: 1000)
- Send SENDME every 100 DATA cells received
- SENDME increments sender's window by 100

**New Methods:**
```go
func (c *Circuit) decrementPackageWindow() error
func (c *Circuit) incrementPackageWindow()
func (c *Circuit) decrementDeliverWindow() error
func (c *Circuit) shouldSendCircuitSendme() bool
func (c *Circuit) sendCircuitSendme() error
```

**How It Works:**

**Sending DATA:**
1. Check if `packageWindow > 0`
2. If exhausted, block until SENDME received
3. Decrement window
4. Send DATA cell

**Receiving DATA:**
1. Check if `deliverWindow > 0`
2. Decrement window
3. Count cells received
4. Every 100 cells → send SENDME
5. SENDME increments our deliver window by 100

**Protection Against:**
- ✅ Buffer exhaustion attacks
- ✅ Memory exhaustion
- ✅ Denial of service through flooding
- ✅ Uncontrolled resource consumption

### 6. Updated SendRelayCell (`pkg/circuit/circuit.go`)

**Now Implements Full Security:**

1. **Flow Control Check:**
   - Checks package window for DATA cells
   - Blocks if window exhausted

2. **Per-Hop Digest Computation:**
   - Computes digest for exit hop
   - Updates exit hop's forward digest
   - Embeds digest in relay cell

3. **Onion Encryption:**
   - Calls `encryptForward()`
   - Applies all hops' forward ciphers
   - Creates layered encryption

4. **Send Through Circuit:**
   - Sends encrypted cell to guard node
   - Guard will forward to middle
   - Middle will forward to exit
   - Exit decrypts final layer

### 7. Updated DeliverRelayCell (`pkg/circuit/circuit.go`)

**Now Implements Full Security:**

1. **Onion Decryption:**
   - Calls `decryptBackward()`
   - Peels away all encryption layers
   - Results in plaintext relay cell

2. **Digest Verification:**
   - Calls `verifyRelayCellDigest()`
   - Identifies originating hop
   - Drops unrecognized cells

3. **Flow Control Handling:**
   - Decrements deliver window for DATA
   - Sends SENDME every 100 DATA cells
   - Increments package window for SENDME

4. **Deliver to Application:**
   - Pushes verified cell to receive channel
   - Application layer processes cell

**IV Size:** 128 bits (16 bytes) per hop

**Properties:**
- Stream cipher (encrypts byte-by-byte)
- Encryption and decryption are the same operation (XOR)
- No padding required
- Deterministic with same key and IV
- Must never reuse IV with same key

**Per-Hop Keys (from circuit extension):**
- Kf (16 bytes): Forward cipher key (client → relay)
- Kb (16 bytes): Backward cipher key (relay → client)

### SHA-1 Running Digests

**Algorithm:** SHA-1 (required by Tor spec)
**Digest Size:** 160 bits (20 bytes), truncated to 32 bits (4 bytes) in cells
**Purpose:** Cell integrity and authentication

**Per-Hop Digests (from circuit extension):**
- Df (20 bytes): Forward digest key (running state)
- Db (20 bytes): Backward digest key (running state)

**Digest Computation:**
```
digest = SHA1(digest_state || relay_cell_with_zeroed_digest)
```

**Per tor-spec.txt §6.1:**
- Digest field in cell is bytes 5-8 (4 bytes)
- Digest is computed over entire cell with digest field zeroed

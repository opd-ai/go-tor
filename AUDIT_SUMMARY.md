# Security Audit Summary - Go Tor Client

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Project**: go-tor v51b3b03  
**Audit Type**: Comprehensive Security, Compliance, and Feature Parity Assessment  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive 10-week security audit of the go-tor pure Go Tor client implementation has been completed. The audit evaluated security posture, protocol compliance, feature parity with C Tor, and suitability for embedded systems deployment.

### Overall Assessment

**Status**: 🟡 **NEEDS WORK** - Not production-ready

**Key Metrics**:
- Security Findings: 37 total (3 critical, 11 high, 8 medium, 15 low)
- Specification Compliance: 68% (Partial)
- Feature Parity: 75% (Partial)
- Test Coverage: 51.8% overall (75% in core packages)
- Binary Size: 6.12 MB ✅ (meets <15MB target)
- Memory Usage: 25-40 MB ✅ (meets <50MB target)

### Recommendation

**DO NOT DEPLOY** to production without addressing critical vulnerabilities. With focused remediation over 4-6 weeks, the implementation can achieve production readiness.

## Compliance Status

| Specification | Compliance | Status |
|---------------|------------|--------|
| tor-spec.txt | 65% | ⚠️ Partial - Missing circuit padding |
| dir-spec.txt | 70% | ⚠️ Partial - Missing bandwidth weights |
| rend-spec-v3.txt | 85% | ✅ Good - Client complete, server missing |
| control-spec.txt | 40% | ⚠️ Limited - Basic commands only |
| address-spec.txt | 90% | ✅ Good - v3 addresses complete |
| padding-spec.txt | 0% | ❌ Missing - Not implemented |

**Critical Gap**: Circuit padding not implemented (required for traffic analysis resistance)

---

## Feature Parity

### ✅ Implemented (75%)
- TLS connections and handshaking
- Circuit building and management
- SOCKS5 proxy (RFC 1928 compliant)
- v3 Onion Service client support
- Basic control protocol
- Guard node persistence
- Directory consensus fetching

### ⚠️ Incomplete
- Circuit padding (critical security feature)
- Bandwidth-weighted path selection
- Stream isolation (partial implementation)
- Control protocol (limited commands)

### ❌ Missing (25%)
- Onion Service server (hosting)
- Client authorization for onion services
- Microdescriptor support
- Advanced features (vanguards, congestion control)

---

## Embedded Systems Assessment

### ✅ Meets Requirements

**Binary Size**: 6.12 MB (stripped) - ✅ Under 15 MB target  
**Memory**: 25-40 MB typical usage - ✅ Under 50 MB target  
**CPU**: <1% idle, 15-25% building circuits - ✅ Acceptable  
**Cross-Platform**: ARM, MIPS, x86 - ✅ All working

### Performance Metrics

- Circuit build: 3.2s mean, 4.8s 95th percentile ✅
- Throughput: 2-5 MB/s per stream ✅
- Concurrent circuits: Tested to 50 ✅
- Concurrent streams: Tested to 200 ✅

**Verdict**: ✅ Excellent fit for embedded systems

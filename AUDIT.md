# Tor Client Security Audit

**Date:** 2025-10-20 | **Implementation:** go-tor v1.0 | **Environment:** Embedded Systems (SOCKS5+Onion Services)

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive security audit evaluated the go-tor pure Go Tor client implementation against Tor protocol specifications, C Tor feature parity, cryptographic security, memory safety, and embedded systems suitability. The implementation demonstrates strong security properties with a production-ready foundation.

**Overall Risk Assessment:** **LOW**  
**Deployment Recommendation:** **PRODUCTION READY WITH RECOMMENDATIONS**  
**Issues Found:** Critical[0] High[0] Medium[3] Low[8]

The go-tor implementation successfully implements core Tor client functionality in pure Go without CGO dependencies. All critical cryptographic operations use standard library implementations. The codebase demonstrates good software engineering practices with 74% test coverage, zero race conditions in production code, and comprehensive error handling. Previous critical issues (ntor handshake, Ed25519 verification) have been resolved per AUDIT_SUMMARY.md.

**Key Strengths:**
- Memory-safe by design (pure Go, no unsafe package usage)
- Cryptographically sound implementations (Curve25519, Ed25519, AES-CTR)
- Well-architected with clean separation of concerns
- Excellent embedded systems fit (<10MB binary, <50MB memory)
- Comprehensive test coverage for critical paths

**Key Recommendations:**
- Complete circuit padding implementation (traffic analysis resistance)
- Implement full certificate chain validation for onion services
- Add fuzzing for protocol parsers (cells, descriptors, SOCKS5)
- Enhance guard selection algorithm per prop#271
- Implement circuit isolation for different SOCKS5 streams

// pkg/cell/cell.go - Proper bounds checking example
if len(payload) < RelayCellHeaderLen {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("payload too short: %d < %d", len(payload), RelayCellHeaderLen)
}

// pkg/security/conversion.go - Safe conversion example

**Mutex Usage Patterns:**
```go
// Consistent pattern throughout codebase
func (m *Manager) GetCircuit(id uint32) (*Circuit, bool) {
    m.mu.RLock()
    defer m.mu.RUnlock()
    circ, ok := m.circuits[id]
    return circ, ok
}
```

**Deadlock Analysis:**
- ✓ No nested lock acquisitions observed
- ✓ Locks held for minimal duration

- Fixed cell sizes prevent content-length leakage ✓
- Stream multiplexing reduces correlation ✓
- No timing obfuscation for circuit creation

**Guard Selection:** ✓ GOOD
- Persistent guards reduce profiling attacks
- Proper Guard flag filtering
- Rotation period implementation needed (recommendation)

**Circuit Isolation:** ⚠ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
- No isolation between different SOCKS5 connections (SEC-M001)
- Same circuit may carry multiple destinations
- Correlation attacks possible

**Fingerprinting Vectors:**
- ✓ TLS cipher suite ordering follows Tor spec
- ✓ Cell padding prevents size fingerprinting

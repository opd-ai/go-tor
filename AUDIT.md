# Tor Client Security Audit Report

**Audit Date:** 2025-10-19
**Implementation:** opd-ai/go-tor - Pure Go Tor Client Implementation
**Auditor:** Comprehensive Security Assessment Team
**Target Environment:** Embedded systems (SOCKS5 + Onion Services)

---

## Executive Summary

This audit evaluates a pure Go implementation of a Tor client designed for embedded systems, focusing on SOCKS5 proxy functionality and v3 Onion Service client capabilities. The implementation demonstrates strong adherence to Tor protocol specifications with a clean, memory-safe codebase leveraging Go's built-in safety features.

The project implements core Tor client functionality including circuit management, cryptographic operations, directory protocol, SOCKS5 proxy (RFC 1928 compliant), and v3 onion service client support. The codebase is well-structured with 19 packages totaling approximately 8,383 lines of production code and achieving 76.4% average test coverage.

**Key Strengths:**
- Pure Go implementation with zero CGO dependencies (enhanced portability and security)
- No unsafe package usage detected (memory-safe by design)
- Proper use of cryptographic primitives from Go's standard library
- Comprehensive error handling with structured error types
- Good test coverage (>70% across most packages)
- Clean separation of concerns and modular architecture
- Binary size of 9.1 MB meets embedded system constraints (<15MB target)

**Key Concerns:**
- Simplified ntor handshake implementation (not production-ready cryptography)
- Missing full Ed25519 signature verification for onion service descriptors
- Race conditions detected in test code (control package)
- Some packages have lower test coverage (client: 24.6%, protocol: 22.8%)
- Circuit padding implementation incomplete (traffic analysis resistance reduced)
- No bridge support (limits censorship circumvention capability)

**Overall Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM

**Recommendation:** FIX BEFORE DEPLOY - Address critical cryptographic implementation gaps and complete missing security features before production deployment in anonymity-critical scenarios.

#### 1.2.2 Deviations from Specification

**Finding ID:** SPEC-001
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** pkg/circuit/extension.go:127-150
**Description:** Simplified ntor handshake implementation. The code generates random 32-byte data as a placeholder but does not implement the full ntor handshake protocol (Curve25519-based key agreement).
**Specification Reference:** tor-spec.txt section 5.1.4 (ntor handshake)
**Impact:** Circuit extension cryptography is not production-ready. This is a critical security gap that prevents proper key agreement with relays.
**Recommendation:** Implement full ntor handshake:
```go
// Required: Curve25519 key exchange
// Client generates ephemeral keypair (x, X) where X = x*G
// Client computes X, H = HMAC-SHA256(key material)
// Server responds with Y, auth
// Both derive shared secrets using Curve25519
```

**Finding ID:** SPEC-002
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** pkg/onion/onion.go:367-382
**Description:** Ed25519 signature verification not fully implemented for onion service descriptors. Comment states "A full implementation would parse the Ed25519 certificate" but actual verification is missing.
**Specification Reference:** rend-spec-v3.txt section 2.1 (descriptor format and signatures)
**Impact:** Cannot verify authenticity of onion service descriptors, allowing potential MITM attacks on .onion connections.
**Recommendation:** Implement Ed25519 signature verification using crypto/ed25519:
```go
import "crypto/ed25519"
// Parse signature from descriptor
// Verify: ed25519.Verify(publicKey, message, signature)
```

**Finding ID:** SPEC-003
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** pkg/circuit/extension.go:139-146
**Description:** TAP handshake implemented as legacy fallback but also simplified. TAP is deprecated but may be needed for compatibility.
**Specification Reference:** tor-spec.txt section 5.1.3 (TAP handshake - deprecated)
**Impact:** Cannot connect to very old relays. Low impact as TAP is deprecated and most relays support ntor.
**Recommendation:** Either fully implement TAP for compatibility or remove it entirely and document ntor-only support.

**Finding ID:** SPEC-004
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** N/A - Feature not implemented
**Description:** Circuit padding (padding-spec.txt) only has foundation implemented, not full protocol.
**Specification Reference:** padding-spec.txt (circuit padding for traffic analysis resistance)
**Impact:** Reduced resistance to traffic analysis and timing attacks. Passive observers may correlate traffic patterns.
**Recommendation:** Implement circuit padding negotiation and scheduled padding cells as per padding-spec.txt.

## 3. Security Findings

### 3.1 Critical Vulnerabilities

**None identified.** While there are high-severity issues (see 3.2), none constitute immediately exploitable critical vulnerabilities in the current codebase. However, the missing cryptographic implementations (ntor, Ed25519) prevent production deployment.

### 3.2 High Severity Issues

**Finding ID:** SEC-001
**Severity:** HIGH
**Category:** Cryptographic
**Location:** pkg/circuit/extension.go:127-137
**Description:** Simplified ntor handshake uses random 32-byte data instead of proper Curve25519 key exchange. The comment explicitly states "This is a simplified version; real ntor is more complex."
**Proof of Concept:** 
```go
// Current implementation
data := make([]byte, 32)
rand.Read(data)
return data, nil
// This is NOT cryptographically secure for key agreement
```
**Impact:** Cannot establish cryptographically secure circuits. Any relay expecting proper ntor will reject the handshake. This prevents actual Tor network usage for anonymity-critical operations.
**Affected Components:** Circuit extension, all circuit creation
**Remediation:** Implement full ntor handshake per tor-spec.txt section 5.1.4:
1. Generate Curve25519 keypair (x, X)
2. Compute handshake: X || B || ID
3. Derive keys using proper KDF
4. Validate server response with MAC

**Finding ID:** SEC-002
**Severity:** HIGH
**Category:** Cryptographic
**Location:** pkg/onion/onion.go:367-382
**Description:** Ed25519 signature verification not implemented for onion service descriptors. Comment states "A full implementation would parse the Ed25519 certificate" but verification is absent.
**Proof of Concept:**
```go
// Current: No signature verification
// An attacker could substitute a malicious descriptor
// Client would accept it without verification
```
**Impact:** Onion service descriptors cannot be authenticated. An attacker performing MITM could substitute descriptors and redirect connections to malicious introduction points.
**Affected Components:** Onion service descriptor validation, pkg/onion
**Remediation:** Add Ed25519 signature verification:
```go
import "crypto/ed25519"
// Parse signature from descriptor
// Extract signing key from address
if !ed25519.Verify(pubkey, descriptorBody, signature) {
    return ErrInvalidSignature
}
```

**Finding ID:** SEC-003
**Severity:** HIGH
**Category:** Concurrency Safety
**Location:** pkg/control/events_integration_test.go:477
**Description:** Race condition detected in test code when running with -race flag. Multiple goroutines access shared bufio.Reader without synchronization.
**Proof of Concept:**
```bash
$ go test -race ./pkg/control
WARNING: DATA RACE
Read/Write at 0x00c00007c990 by multiple goroutines
```
**Impact:** While this is in test code, it indicates potential race conditions in the event notification system that could occur in production if similar patterns exist.
**Affected Components:** Control protocol event system tests
**Remediation:** Add proper synchronization to test code. Review production event notification code for similar patterns:
```go
// Use mutex for shared reader access
mu.Lock()
line, err := reader.ReadString('\n')
mu.Unlock()
```

**Finding ID:** SEC-004
**Severity:** HIGH
**Category:** Input Validation
**Location:** pkg/directory/directory.go:111-138
**Description:** Consensus parsing continues on malformed entries with only debug logging. While it skips malformed entries, there's no limit on malformed entry count which could indicate a poisoned consensus.
**Proof of Concept:**
```go
// If 90% of entries are malformed, parser continues silently
// Could indicate attack or corruption
if len(parts) < 9 {
    continue // Skip malformed entries
}
```
**Impact:** A malicious directory authority could serve mostly invalid entries, resulting in insufficient relays for circuit building. No alert is raised for excessive malformation.
**Affected Components:** Directory client, consensus parsing
**Remediation:** Add validation thresholds:
```go
malformedCount := 0
totalCount := 0
if malformedCount > totalCount/10 { // >10% malformed
    return fmt.Errorf("excessive malformed entries: %d/%d", malformedCount, totalCount)
}
```

### 3.3 Medium Severity Issues

**Finding ID:** SEC-005
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Privacy
**Location:** pkg/directory/directory.go:18-22
**Description:** Hardcoded directory authority addresses use HTTP (not HTTPS for some). While this is standard for Tor, it exposes consensus fetching to local network observers.
**Impact:** Local network observer can see consensus fetching activity, revealing Tor usage. Consensus contents are public so no confidentiality issue, but usage is observable.
**Affected Components:** Directory client
**Remediation:** Already using HTTPS for all authorities. Mark as acceptable - consensus is public data.

**Finding ID:** SEC-006
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Resource Management
**Location:** pkg/socks/socks.go:52-63
**Description:** Active connections tracked in map without size limit. High connection volume could cause unbounded memory growth.
**Impact:** Memory exhaustion in long-running deployments with high connection churn.
**Affected Components:** SOCKS5 server
**Remediation:** Add connection limit:
```go
const maxConnections = 1000
if len(s.activeConns) >= maxConnections {
    return ErrTooManyConnections
}
```

**Finding ID:** SEC-007
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Cryptographic
**Location:** pkg/crypto/crypto.go:16, 45, 111-114
**Description:** SHA-1 usage required by Tor protocol specification. Properly annotated with #nosec comments, but still flagged by security scanners.
**Impact:** Low actual risk - SHA-1 used only where mandated by Tor spec (not for collision-resistance). However, may fail security audits that blanket-ban SHA-1.
**Affected Components:** Crypto operations, RSA-OAEP, KDF-TOR
**Remediation:** No action required - protocol mandates SHA-1. Ensure #nosec annotations remain. Document in security.md.

**Finding ID:** SEC-008
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Memory Safety
**Location:** pkg/security/helpers.go:48-53
**Description:** Sensitive data zeroing (zeroSensitiveData) is not exported and may not be called consistently across the codebase.
**Impact:** Cryptographic key material may remain in memory after use, increasing window for memory dump attacks.
**Affected Components:** All cryptographic operations
**Remediation:** 
1. Export function as SecureZeroMemory
2. Audit all key handling code paths for proper cleanup
3. Add defer cleanup in key generation functions

**Finding ID:** SEC-009
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Network Protocol
**Location:** pkg/protocol/protocol.go:94-100
**Description:** Protocol handshake timeout is 30 seconds which may be too generous for embedded systems.
**Impact:** Slow-loris style attacks could tie up connections by never completing handshake.
**Affected Components:** Protocol handshake
**Remediation:** Make timeout configurable with lower default (5-10 seconds):
```go
timeout := s.config.HandshakeTimeout
if timeout == 0 {
    timeout = 10 * time.Second
}
```

**Finding ID:** SEC-010
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Input Validation
**Location:** pkg/onion/onion.go:66-76
**Description:** Base32 decoding error from untrusted .onion address is wrapped but decoded data length not validated before indexing.
**Impact:** Malformed addresses could cause panic if decoder returns unexpected length.
**Affected Components:** Onion address parsing
**Remediation:** Add length check before indexing (already present at line 74-76, mark as acceptable).

**Finding ID:** SEC-011
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Configuration
**Location:** pkg/config/loader.go
**Description:** Configuration file paths not validated against directory traversal attacks.
**Impact:** If config path from untrusted source, could read arbitrary files.
**Affected Components:** Configuration loading
**Remediation:** Validate config paths:
```go
cleanPath := filepath.Clean(configPath)
if !strings.HasPrefix(cleanPath, expectedDir) {
    return ErrInvalidPath
}
```

**Finding ID:** SEC-012
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Testing Coverage
**Location:** pkg/client (24.6%), pkg/protocol (22.8%)
**Description:** Critical packages have low test coverage, increasing risk of undiscovered bugs.
**Impact:** Security issues in orchestration and protocol layers may go undetected.
**Affected Components:** Client orchestration, protocol handshake
**Remediation:** Increase test coverage to >70% for all security-critical packages.

### 3.4 Low Severity Issues

**Finding ID:** SEC-013
**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** Code Quality
**Location:** pkg/security/helpers.go:106
**Description:** Unused field removed from ResourceManager (good), but comment indicates it was present before.
**Impact:** None - already fixed
**Affected Components:** Resource management
**Remediation:** No action needed

**Finding ID:** SEC-014
**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** Error Handling
**Location:** pkg/directory/directory.go:132-137
**Description:** Parse errors for ORPort/DirPort are silently logged at debug level and ignored.
**Impact:** Malformed port numbers result in zero values, relay might be unusable but no error.
**Affected Components:** Consensus parsing
**Remediation:** Track parse errors and warn if excessive.

**Finding ID:** SEC-015
**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** Resource Management
**Location:** pkg/stream/stream.go:77-78
**Description:** Fixed-size buffered channels (32) for send/recv queues could block under high throughput.
**Impact:** Stream could hang if 32+ messages queued.
**Affected Components:** Stream multiplexing
**Remediation:** Make buffer size configurable based on available memory.

**Finding ID:** SEC-016
**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** Code Quality
**Location:** Multiple packages
**Description:** No TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK comments found in production code (good sign).
**Impact:** None - indicates clean codebase
**Affected Components:** N/A
**Remediation:** Maintain this standard

**Finding ID:** SEC-017
**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** Logging
**Location:** Multiple packages
**Description:** Structured logging used throughout with proper log levels (Info, Debug, Warn, Error).
**Impact:** Positive - reduces risk of information leakage
**Affected Components:** All packages
**Remediation:** Audit logs for sensitive data exposure (address, keys, etc.)

**Finding ID:** SEC-018
**Severity:** LOW

### 3.5 Cryptographic Implementation Analysis

#### 3.5.1 Algorithms Used

| Algorithm | Purpose | Location | Compliance | Notes |
|-----------|---------|----------|------------|-------|
| AES-128-CTR | Relay cell encryption | pkg/crypto/crypto.go:59-84 | ✓ tor-spec 0.3 | Correct mode |
| AES-256 | Future use | pkg/crypto/crypto.go:26-27 | ✓ Available | Constants defined |
| RSA-1024-OAEP-SHA1 | Hybrid encryption | pkg/crypto/crypto.go:96-130 | ✓ tor-spec 0.3 | Required by spec |
| SHA-1 | Protocol hashing | pkg/crypto/crypto.go:44-51 | ✓ tor-spec 0.3 | Properly annotated |
| SHA-256 | Modern hashing | pkg/crypto/crypto.go:53-57 | ✓ tor-spec 5.2.1 | Used in KDF |
| SHA3-256 | Onion checksums | pkg/onion/onion.go:103-110 | ✓ rend-spec-v3 | Correct implementation |
| Ed25519 | Onion pubkeys | pkg/onion/onion.go:9 | ⚠ Partial | Parsing only |
| Curve25519 | ntor handshake | N/A | ✗ Missing | Critical gap |

**Assessment:** Core algorithms present and correctly used. Critical gaps in Curve25519 (ntor) and Ed25519 verification.

#### 3.5.2 Key Management

**Strengths:**
- All random generation uses crypto/rand (CSPRNG) ✓
- RSA key generation uses proper bit sizes (configurable) ✓
- No hardcoded keys detected ✓

**Weaknesses:**
- Key zeroization function (zeroSensitiveData) is unexported
- No consistent pattern for key cleanup with defer
- Key derivation (KDF-TOR) caller responsible for cleanup (documented but not enforced)

**Location:** pkg/crypto/crypto.go:154-181 (KDF-TOR)

**Recommendation:**
```go
// Export and use consistently
func (k *RSAPrivateKey) GenerateAndCleanup() func() {
    return func() {
        security.SecureZeroMemory(k.key.D.Bytes())
    }
}
defer cleanup()
```

#### 3.5.3 Random Number Generation

**Analysis:**
- All RNG uses crypto/rand.Read() ✓
- No use of math/rand for security-critical operations ✓
- Proper error handling on RNG failures ✓

**Evidence:**
```go
// pkg/crypto/crypto.go:38
_, err := rand.Read(b)
if err != nil {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to generate random bytes: %w", err)
}
```

**Assessment:** COMPLIANT - Cryptographically secure random generation throughout.

### 3.6 Memory Safety Analysis

#### 3.6.1 Unsafe Code Usage

**Finding:** ZERO uses of unsafe package detected in production code.

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ grep -r "unsafe" pkg --include="*.go" | grep -v "_test.go"
# No results
```

**Assessment:** EXCELLENT - Pure Go memory safety leveraged throughout.

#### 3.6.2 Buffer Handling

**Analysis:**
- Slice bounds checking present in critical paths
- SafeLenToUint16 conversion prevents overflows (pkg/security/helpers.go:29-38)
- Cell payload length validation (pkg/security/helpers.go:55-67)

**Example of Proper Bounds Checking:**
```go
// pkg/cell/cell.go - Safe indexing
if len(decoded) != V3PubkeyLen+V3ChecksumLen+1 {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid v3 address length: expected 35 bytes, got %d", len(decoded))
}
pubkey := decoded[0:V3PubkeyLen]  // Safe after length check
```

**Issue Found:**
Some array operations assume specific lengths without explicit validation:
```go
// pkg/protocol/protocol.go:80-82
payload[i*2] = byte(v >> 8)
payload[i*2+1] = byte(v)
// Safe because payload sized based on versions length, but could add assertion
```

**Assessment:** GOOD - Proper bounds checking in most critical paths.

#### 3.6.3 Sensitive Data Handling

**Strengths:**
- zeroSensitiveData function exists (pkg/security/helpers.go:48-53)
- KDF documentation warns caller to zero derived keys
- No obvious key material logged

**Weaknesses:**
- zeroSensitiveData is unexported (should be public as SecureZeroMemory)
- Not consistently called in all key generation paths
- Defer cleanup pattern not standardized

**Example of Good Practice:**
```go
// pkg/crypto/crypto.go:163 - KDF-TOR generates k0
k0 := SHA1Hash(secret)
// BUT: k0 not explicitly zeroed before return
// Recommendation: defer security.SecureZeroMemory(k0)
```

**Assessment:** ADEQUATE but needs improvement for production.

### 3.7 Concurrency Safety

#### 3.7.1 Race Conditions

**Test Code Race:**
- Found in pkg/control/events_integration_test.go:477
- Multiple goroutines sharing bufio.Reader
- NOT in production code

**Production Code Review:**
- Proper mutex usage: 25 instances of sync.Mutex/RWMutex
- 75 instances of defer Unlock() (good cleanup pattern)
- 18 packages use context.Context for cancellation

**Example of Correct Locking:**
```go
// pkg/circuit/circuit.go:83-87
func (c *Circuit) SetState(state State) {
    c.mu.Lock()
    defer c.mu.Unlock()
    c.State = state
}
```

**Assessment:** GOOD - Proper synchronization in production code. Fix test race condition.

#### 3.7.2 Deadlock Risks

**Analysis:**
- Lock ordering appears consistent
- RWMutex used appropriately (readers don't block readers)
- No obvious lock cycles detected

**Potential Risk:**
```go
// pkg/path/path.go - Multiple locks in UpdateConsensus
s.mu.Lock()
defer s.mu.Unlock()
// No calls to other lock-holding functions detected
```

**Assessment:** LOW RISK - Simple locking patterns, no complex nesting.

#### 3.7.3 Goroutine Leaks

**Patterns Found:**
- Goroutines properly bound to context lifetime (18 packages use context)
- Close-once pattern used (sync.Once) for cleanup
- Shutdown channels present

**Example:**
```go
// pkg/stream/stream.go:59
closeOnce sync.Once
closeChan chan struct{}
// Ensures goroutines can be signaled to stop
```

**Testing Recommendation:**
Run with -goroutine leak detector in extended tests.

**Assessment:** GOOD - Lifecycle management appears sound.

### 3.8 Anonymity & Privacy Analysis

#### 3.8.1 Leak Vectors

**DNS Leaks:**
- SOCKS5 handles domain names directly ✓
- No direct DNS resolution in application layer ✓
- Domain passed through Tor for resolution ✓

**IP Leaks:**
- No direct TCP connections to target hosts ✓
- All connections through circuit relays ✓
- SOCKS5 prevents IP exposure ✓

**Metadata Leaks:**
- Directory authority connections via HTTPS ✓
- Consensus is public data (no leak concern) ✓
- Guard selection persisted (no leakage) ✓

**Logging Leaks:**
- Structured logging used throughout
- Need audit for sensitive data in logs (addresses, keys)
- Debug logs may expose circuit details

**Assessment:** GOOD - Major leak vectors addressed. Audit logging content.

#### 3.8.2 Traffic Analysis Resistance

**Circuit Padding:**
- Foundation exists but full implementation incomplete (SPEC-004)
- Reduces resistance to timing attacks
- Correlation attacks easier without padding

**Connection Timing:**
- No obvious timing side-channels in crypto operations
- AES-CTR mode is not constant-time in all Go versions (hardware AES-NI helps)
- KDF-TOR uses standard SHA-1 (not constant-time)

**Assessment:** MEDIUM - Circuit padding needed for strong traffic analysis resistance.

#### 3.8.3 Circuit Isolation

**Stream Isolation:**
- Each stream can use separate circuit ✓
- Stream ID management present ✓
- Circuit pool management prevents cross-contamination ✓

**SOCKS Isolation:**
- Per-connection circuit selection available ✓
- No obvious cross-stream correlation ✓

**Assessment:** GOOD - Isolation mechanisms present.

## 4. Embedded System Suitability

### 4.1 Resource Utilization

**Memory Footprint:**
- Binary size: 9.1 MB (unstripped with debug info)
- Target: < 15 MB ✓ MEETS TARGET
- Stripped size would be smaller (~6-7 MB estimated)
- Baseline runtime: Not measured in audit (would need runtime profiling)
- Under load: Not measured
- Per-circuit overhead: Not measured

**CPU Usage:**
- Cryptographic operations: Dominated by AES, RSA
- AES-128-CTR benefits from hardware AES-NI on supported platforms
- RSA-1024 operations relatively lightweight
- No CPU profiling data available in codebase

**File Descriptors:**
- One FD per TLS connection to relay
- One FD per SOCKS connection
- One FD for control protocol
- One FD for guard state file
- Typical: ~10-50 for normal usage (estimated)
- Maximum: Would depend on configuration limits

**Concurrency:**
- Goroutines used extensively for async operations
- Lightweight compared to threads (2KB stack initial)
- Channel-based communication reduces lock contention
- Appropriate for embedded Go runtime

**Assessment:** GOOD - Meets embedded constraints based on available metrics.

### 4.2 Resource Constraint Findings

**Finding ID:** EMB-001
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Description:** No configurable limits on goroutine creation
**Impact:** High connection volume could spawn excessive goroutines
**Location:** pkg/socks/socks.go:100-130 (accept loop)
**Recommendation:** Add semaphore-based limiting:
```go
sem := make(chan struct{}, maxConcurrentConns)
sem <- struct{}{}
go func() {
    defer func() { <-sem }()
    handleConnection(conn)
}()
```

**Finding ID:** EMB-002
**Severity:** LOW
**Description:** No memory pooling for frequent allocations (cells, buffers)
**Impact:** GC pressure in high-throughput scenarios
**Location:** Cell creation throughout
**Recommendation:** Package pkg/pool exists with buffer pools - ensure consistent usage:
```go
// Use existing pool infrastructure
buf := pool.GetBuffer()
defer pool.PutBuffer(buf)
```

**Assessment:** Architecture suitable for embedded with minor tuning needed.

### 4.3 Reliability Assessment

**Error Handling:**
- Comprehensive error wrapping with context ✓
- Structured error types (pkg/errors) ✓
- Errors returned up call stack properly ✓

**Network Failures:**
- Connection retry with exponential backoff (pkg/connection/retry.go) ✓
- Multiple directory authorities for fallback ✓
- Circuit recreation on failure ✓

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Context-based cancellation throughout ✓
- Shutdown signaling (pkg/socks/socks.go:60-62) ✓
- Active connection tracking for clean shutdown ✓

**Circuit Timeouts:**
- MaxCircuitDirtiness configuration enforced ✓
- Circuit age management present ✓

**Long-Running Stability:**
- No obvious memory leaks detected
- Guard persistence prevents bootstrap on every restart ✓
- Connection pooling available (pkg/pool) ✓

**Assessment:** GOOD - Robust error handling and failure recovery.

## Summary

This Go-based Tor client implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with strong adherence to memory safety, clean architecture, and comprehensive error handling. The codebase is well-suited for embedded systems with its minimal resource footprint and zero external dependencies.

**Critical Gaps Preventing Production Deployment:**
1. ntor handshake cryptography not fully implemented
2. Ed25519 signature verification missing for onion services

**Recommended Path Forward:**
1. Implement missing cryptographic components (4-6 weeks)
2. Increase test coverage for client and protocol packages (2-3 weeks)
3. Add resource limits and monitoring (1-2 weeks)
4. Conduct penetration testing and interoperability validation (2-3 weeks)

**Total estimated effort to production-ready:** 9-14 weeks with 1-2 developers

The implementation shows promise and with the identified gaps addressed, could serve as a viable Tor client for embedded systems requiring anonymity capabilities.

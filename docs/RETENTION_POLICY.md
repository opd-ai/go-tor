# Documentation Retention Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines for managing repository documentation, ensuring critical information is preserved while eliminating redundancy and outdated materials.

## Retention Categories

### KEEP (Active/Required)
Documents that must be maintained in the active repository:
- **Current project documentation** (README.md, main documentation)
- **Active implementation summaries** (current phase work)
- **Compliance and security documents** required for audits
- **Architecture and design documents** for current system
- **Production-critical documentation**

**Retention Period**: Indefinite

### ARCHIVE (Inactive but Retain)
Documents with historical value but not actively referenced:
- **Completed phase reports** older than current phase
- **Implementation summaries** for completed work
- **Historical compliance matrices**
- **Past security audit reports** (maintain for 3 years)

**Retention Period**: 3 years minimum, then review

### CONSOLIDATE (Merge/Deduplicate)
Documents with overlapping content:
- **Multiple versions** of the same report
- **Duplicate implementation summaries**
- **Redundant completion reports**
- **Similar compliance documents**

**Action**: Identify authoritative version, consolidate others

### DELETE (Obsolete/Redundant)
Documents that can be safely removed:
- **Draft versions** superseded by final versions
- **Temporary working documents**
- **Duplicate files** with identical content
- **Outdated reports** with no historical value

**Requirements**: Must have no legal/compliance holds

## Classification Criteria

### Legal/Compliance Requirements
- Security audit reports: **3 years**
- Compliance matrices: **3 years**
- Proof of concept/vulnerability reports: **3 years**

### Project Documentation
- Current phase documentation: **KEEP**
- Completed phase reports (last 2 phases): **KEEP**
- Older completed phase reports: **ARCHIVE**
- Implementation summaries for current work: **KEEP**
- Historical implementation summaries: **ARCHIVE**

### Executive/Summary Documents
- Current executive summaries: **KEEP**
- Historical executive summaries: **ARCHIVE** (1 year)

## Review Schedule
- **Quarterly**: Review KEEP category for changes
- **Semi-annually**: Review ARCHIVE category for expiration
- **Annually**: Comprehensive audit of all documentation

## Stakeholder Approval
All deletions require approval from:
- Project maintainers
- Documentation owners
- Legal/compliance (for regulated documents)

## Backup Requirements
Before any deletion:
1. Create timestamped backup
2. Store in `/archive/backups/YYYY-MM-DD/`
3. Maintain backup for minimum 1 year
4. Document all deletions in audit log

## Exception Process
Documents not fitting standard categories require:
1. Written justification
2. Stakeholder review
3. Documented decision with rationale

     - *Impact*: Edge case in time handling
     - *Fix*: 4 hours work

2. **Medium-Priority Issues (4)**
   - File path validation needed
   - Some packages need more tests
   - Circuit padding partially implemented
   - Path validation in config loading

3. **Missing Features**
   - Client authorization for private services
   - Bridge support for censored networks
   - Full circuit padding (traffic analysis resistance)
   - These are enhancements, not blockers

### What This Means

**Security**: The implementation is fundamentally secure with no critical vulnerabilities. The 2 high-priority issues are edge cases that should be fixed but don't represent systemic security flaws.

**Reliability**: Strong test coverage and clean static analysis indicate a stable, reliable implementation. The integration test gaps are acceptable for initial release.

**Performance**: Meets most performance targets. Circuit build time slightly exceeds target but is acceptable for production use.

**Compliance**: High compliance with Tor specifications. Missing features are primarily "nice-to-have" rather than essential.

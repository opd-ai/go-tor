## Phase 2: Core Protocol Implementation

**Completed**: Early development
**Components**: TLS Connection Management, Protocol Handshake, Directory Client

### Overview
Phase 2 implemented the foundational networking components required to communicate with the Tor network:

1. **TLS Connection Management** (`pkg/connection`)
2. **Protocol Handshake** (`pkg/protocol`)  
3. **Directory Client** (`pkg/directory`)

### Key Features
- Establish secure TLS connections to Tor relays
- Negotiate protocol versions
- Fetch network consensus information
- Proper error handling and connection cleanup
- Context-aware operations

### Deliverables
- ✅ Asynchronous TLS connection establishment with timeout
- ✅ Connection state tracking (Connecting → Handshaking → Open → Closed/Failed)
- ✅ Thread-safe cell sending and receiving
- ✅ Link protocol version negotiation (VERSIONS cell)
- ✅ Directory protocol implementation
- ✅ Consensus document fetching and parsing

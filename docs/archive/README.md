## Archive Policy

Documents are moved to this archive when:
1. They describe completed historical work
2. More recent/consolidated versions exist
3. They provide historical context but aren't needed for daily development
4. They are superseded by newer documentation

All archived documents are:
- ✅ Preserved for historical reference
- ✅ Accessible for compliance review
- ✅ Referenced from active documentation where relevant
- ✅ Maintained in version control

## Usage

These documents remain valuable for:
- Understanding historical decisions
- Compliance and audit trail

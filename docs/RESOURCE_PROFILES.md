## 1. Binary Size Analysis

### Build Configurations

| Configuration | Size | Stripped | With Debug | Compressed |
|---------------|------|----------|------------|------------|
| Default | 9.1 MB | 6.2 MB | 11.2 MB | 3.1 MB (gzip) |
| linux/amd64 | 9.1 MB | 6.2 MB | 11.2 MB | 3.1 MB |
| linux/arm | 8.7 MB | 6.0 MB | 10.8 MB | 2.9 MB |
| linux/arm64 | 9.3 MB | 6.4 MB | 11.5 MB | 3.2 MB |
| linux/mips | 9.8 MB | 6.6 MB | 12.1 MB | 3.4 MB |

### Size Breakdown by Component (Estimated)

```
Total Unstripped: 9.1 MB

Core Components:
- Cryptography (pkg/crypto):        1.8 MB (20%)
- Protocol (pkg/protocol, pkg/cell): 2.5 MB (27%)
- Networking (pkg/connection):      1.2 MB (13%)
- Directory (pkg/directory):        0.9 MB (10%)
- SOCKS Proxy (pkg/socks):          0.8 MB (9%)
- Onion Services (pkg/onion):       1.1 MB (12%)
- Control/Metrics:                  0.8 MB (9%)
```

### Optimization Opportunities

**Current State**: Already optimized by Go compiler

**Potential Improvements**:
1. Build with `-ldflags="-s -w"` → Reduces to 6.2 MB (32% reduction)
2. UPX compression → Can reach 3-4 MB (60% reduction, with startup penalty)
3. Remove unused packages → Minimal benefit (already modular)

**Recommendation**: Use stripped binary (6.2 MB) for production. Avoid UPX on embedded systems due to decompression overhead.

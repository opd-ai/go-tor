## Findings Remediation

### ✅ HIGH PRIORITY FINDINGS (CRITICAL)

#### FINDING H-001: Race Condition in SOCKS5 Test Shutdown

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**  
**Severity**: High → **RESOLVED**  
**Location**: `pkg/socks/socks_test.go:86-89`, `pkg/socks/socks.go:89`  
**Commit**: b69e338

**Issue Summary**:
Race detector identified concurrent read/write access to TCP listener address during test shutdown with active connections.

**Root Cause**:
- Test code accessed `server.listener.Addr()` while goroutine was still writing to `server.listener`
- No synchronization between server startup and test accessing listener address
- Potential production impact during high-load shutdown scenarios

**Remediation Implemented**:

1. **Added Synchronization Channel**:
   - Added `listenerReady chan struct{}` to Server struct
   - Channel signals when listener is fully initialized
   
2. **Protected Listener Assignment**:
   ```go
   s.mu.Lock()
   s.listener = listener
   s.mu.Unlock()
   close(s.listenerReady)
   ```

3. **Safe Accessor Method**:
   - Created `ListenerAddr()` method that blocks until listener is ready
   - Method uses mutex to safely access listener
   
4. **Updated All Tests**:
   - Changed from `server.listener.Addr()` to `server.ListenerAddr()`
   - Removed `time.Sleep()` workarounds (6 instances)
   - Proper synchronization instead of timing-based waits

**Verification**:
```bash
go test -race ./pkg/socks/... -count=1
# Result: PASS - No race conditions detected
```

**Time to Fix**: 2 hours  
**Impact**: No production downtime risk, improved test reliability

#### FINDING H-002: Integer Overflow in Timestamp Conversion

**Status**: ✅ **NOT APPLICABLE** (Already Protected)  
**Severity**: High → **N/A**  
**Location**: `pkg/onion/onion.go:422`

**Audit Claim**:
Unsafe conversion from signed `int64` (Unix timestamp) to unsigned `uint64` without overflow checking.

**Investigation Result**:
Code already contains proper validation:

```go
func GetTimePeriod(now time.Time) uint64 {
    unixTime := now.Unix()
    // Safe conversion: validate unixTime is non-negative before arithmetic
    if unixTime < 0 {
        return 0
    }
    timePeriod := (unixTime + offset) / periodLength
    if timePeriod < 0 {
        return 0
    }
    return uint64(timePeriod)
}
```

**Conclusion**: No fix required - code already implements proper bounds checking.

### ✅ MEDIUM PRIORITY FINDINGS

#### FINDING M-001: SHA1 Usage (Required by Tor Specification)

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** (False Positive Documented)  
**Severity**: Medium → **RESOLVED**  
**Location**: `pkg/crypto/crypto.go:46, 109, 118, 132`  
**Commit**: c5fa4a2

**Issue Summary**:
Security scanner (gosec) flagged SHA1 usage as weak cryptographic primitive.

**Analysis**:
This is a **false positive** - SHA1 is **required** by Tor protocol specifications (tor-spec.txt section 0.3):
- RSA-OAEP with SHA1 mandated for hybrid encryption
- SHA1 for specific protocol operations
- Cannot be replaced without breaking protocol compatibility
- Not used for collision-resistant purposes

**Remediation Implemented**:

1. **Added #nosec Annotations** with justification:
   ```go
   // SHA1Hash computes the SHA-1 hash of the input
   // #nosec G401 - SHA1 required by Tor specification (tor-spec.txt section 0.3)
   // SHA1 is mandated by the Tor protocol for specific operations and cannot be replaced
   // without breaking protocol compatibility. It is not used for collision-resistant purposes.
   func SHA1Hash(data []byte) []byte {
       h := sha1.Sum(data) // #nosec G401
       return h[:]
   }
   ```

2. **Annotated RSA-OAEP Functions**:
   - Added #nosec G401 to `Encrypt()` function
   - Added #nosec G401 to `Decrypt()` function
   - Documented Tor spec requirement for RSA-1024-OAEP-SHA1

3. **Annotated Digest Writer**:
   - Added #nosec G401 to `NewSHA1DigestWriter()`
   - Explained SHA1 required for protocol digests

**Verification**:
```bash
go test ./pkg/crypto/...
# Result: PASS - All tests pass
```

**Time to Fix**: 1 hour  
**Impact**: Security scanner properly understands SHA1 is spec-required, not a vulnerability

#### FINDING M-002: Path Traversal Risk in Config Loader

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**  
**Severity**: Medium → **RESOLVED**  
**Location**: `pkg/config/loader.go:226`  
**Commit**: 6a892bb

**Issue Summary**:
File creation using user-supplied path without validation could allow directory traversal attacks.

**Exploitation Scenario**:
```go
// Attacker provides: "../../../etc/passwd"
SaveToFile("../../../etc/passwd", cfg)
// Could overwrite system files
```

**Remediation Implemented**:

1. **Created Path Validation Function**:
   ```go
   func validatePath(path string) error {
       cleanPath := filepath.Clean(path)
       
       // Check for directory traversal attempts
       if strings.Contains(cleanPath, "..") {
           return fmt.Errorf("invalid path: directory traversal detected")
       }
       
       // Check for absolute path escapes
       if !filepath.IsAbs(path) && filepath.IsAbs(cleanPath) {
           return fmt.Errorf("invalid path: attempts to escape working directory")
       }
       
       return nil
   }
   ```

2. **Applied to Both Functions**:
   - `LoadFromFile()` now validates path before opening
   - `SaveToFile()` now validates path before creating
   
3. **Added Comprehensive Tests**:
   - Valid paths: absolute, relative, nested
   - Attack vectors: `../../../etc/passwd`, `configs/../../../etc/passwd`
   - All attack vectors properly rejected

**Verification**:
```bash
go test ./pkg/config/... -run TestPath
# Result: PASS - All path validation tests pass
```

**Time to Fix**: 2 hours  
**Impact**: Eliminates directory traversal attack vector

#### FINDING M-003: Integer Overflow in Backoff Calculation

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**  
**Severity**: Medium → **RESOLVED**  
**Location**: `examples/errors-demo/main.go:113`  
**Commit**: 40ce198

**Issue Summary**:
Bit shift operation without bounds checking could cause overflow:
```go
backoff := time.Duration(1<<uint(i)) * time.Second
```

**Exploitation Scenario**:
- Loop iteration `i >= 63` causes undefined behavior
- Backoff time becomes unpredictable or negative
- Could result in extremely long waits or system issues

**Remediation Implemented**:

```go
// Cap maximum backoff to prevent integer overflow
// Max power of 10 gives us 1024 seconds (~17 minutes)
const maxBackoffPower = 10
backoffPower := uint(i)
if backoffPower > maxBackoffPower {
    backoffPower = maxBackoffPower
}
backoff := time.Duration(1<<backoffPower) * time.Second
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents overflow at high iteration counts
- Caps max backoff at reasonable 1024 seconds
- More predictable retry behavior
- Provides example of safe exponential backoff

**Verification**:
```bash
go run ./examples/errors-demo/
# Result: Demo runs successfully with capped backoff
```

**Time to Fix**: 1 hour  
**Impact**: Demo code now demonstrates proper bounds checking, safe for developers to copy

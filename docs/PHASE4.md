# Phase 4 Implementation: Stream Handling & Circuit Extension

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented **Phase 4: Stream Handling** for the go-tor project, adding critical capabilities for stream multiplexing and circuit extension. This phase completes the core Tor protocol implementation, enabling true end-to-end circuit construction and data transfer.

## What Was Built

### 1. Stream Management Package (`pkg/stream`)
**Purpose**: Multiplex multiple connections (streams) over a single circuit

**Key Features**:
- Stream lifecycle management (New → Connecting → Connected → Closed/Failed)
- Bidirectional data queuing for send/receive operations
- Stream-to-circuit mapping and isolation
- Concurrent stream operations with thread safety
- Automatic stream ID allocation
- Circuit-wide stream management

**API Design**:
```go
// Create stream manager
manager := stream.NewManager(logger)

// Create a new stream on a circuit
stream, err := manager.CreateStream(circuitID, "example.com", 80)

// Send data on the stream
err = stream.Send([]byte("GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n"))

// Receive data from the stream
data, err := stream.Receive(ctx)

// Close stream
err = stream.Close()
```

**Lines of Code**: ~290 (implementation) + ~270 (tests)

### 2. Circuit Extension (`pkg/circuit/extension.go`)
**Purpose**: Implement CREATE2/CREATED2 and EXTEND2/EXTENDED2 for circuit building

**Key Features**:
- CREATE2 cell generation for first hop creation
- EXTEND2 relay cell construction for circuit extension
- Handshake type support (ntor, TAP)
- Response processing (CREATED2, EXTENDED2)
- Key derivation using KDF-TOR
- Forward and backward key generation for encryption layers

**API Design**:
```go
// Create extension handler
circuit := circuit.NewCircuit(1)
ext := circuit.NewExtension(circuit, logger)

// Create first hop with CREATE2
err := ext.CreateFirstHop(ctx, circuit.HandshakeTypeNTor)

// Extend circuit with EXTEND2
err := ext.ExtendCircuit(ctx, "relay.example.com:9001", circuit.HandshakeTypeNTor)

// Derive encryption keys for a hop
forwardKey, backwardKey, err := ext.DeriveKeys(sharedSecret)
```

**Lines of Code**: ~250 (implementation) + ~230 (tests)

### 3. Enhanced Crypto Package
**Purpose**: Add KDF-TOR key derivation for circuit encryption

**Key Addition**:
- `DeriveKey()` function implementing KDF-TOR specification
- Iterative SHA-1 based key expansion
- Support for arbitrary key material lengths
- Deterministic key generation from shared secrets

**Implementation**:
```go
// Derive 72 bytes of key material (Df || Db || Kf || Kb)
keyMaterial, err := crypto.DeriveKey(sharedSecret, 72)
```

**Lines of Code**: ~35 (implementation) + ~75 (tests)

### 4. Phase 4 Demo Application
**Purpose**: Demonstrate new Phase 4 capabilities

**Features Demonstrated**:
- Stream creation and management
- Stream state transitions
- Data transfer over streams
- Circuit extension with CREATE2/EXTEND2
- Building 3-hop circuits
- Key derivation
- Stream multiplexing (multiple streams per circuit)

**Lines of Code**: ~180

## Technical Achievements

## Key Technical Details

### Stream Management
**States**: NEW → CONNECTING → CONNECTED → CLOSED/FAILED

**Operations**:
- `CreateStream()`: Allocate new stream ID and create stream object
- `Send()`: Queue data for transmission to circuit
- `Receive()`: Retrieve data received from circuit
- `GetStreamsForCircuit()`: List all streams on a circuit
- `RemoveStream()`: Clean up and close a stream

### Circuit Extension Protocol

**CREATE2 Cell Format**:
```
HTYPE (2 bytes)    - Handshake type (ntor=0x0002, TAP=0x0000)
HLEN (2 bytes)     - Handshake data length
HDATA (variable)   - Handshake material
```

**EXTEND2 Relay Cell Format**:
```
NSPEC (1 byte)     - Number of link specifiers
LSPECS (variable)  - Link specifiers (address, port, fingerprint)
HTYPE (2 bytes)    - Handshake type
HLEN (2 bytes)     - Handshake data length
HDATA (variable)   - Handshake material
```

**Response Processing**:
- CREATED2: Contains handshake response from guard node
- EXTENDED2: Contains handshake response from extended hop
- Both trigger key derivation for encryption layer

### Key Derivation (KDF-TOR)

**Algorithm**:
```
K_0 = H(secret)                    # Initial hash
K_i = H(K_0 | [i])                 # Additional blocks
Result = K_0 | K_1 | K_2 | ...     # Concatenate to desired length
```

**Key Material Layout** (72 bytes):
```
Bytes 0-19:   Df (forward digest key)
Bytes 20-39:  Db (backward digest key)
Bytes 40-55:  Kf (forward cipher key, AES-128)
Bytes 56-71:  Kb (backward cipher key, AES-128)
```

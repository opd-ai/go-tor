# Stream Protocol Implementation Status

**STATUS:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Stream relay functionality is fully operational

## Summary

The SOCKS5 proxy server successfully relays connections through Tor circuits. The stream protocol layer has been fully implemented and integrated.

## Implementation Complete

All required components are implemented:

### Core Functionality ✅
- **Circuit Operations**: `SendRelayCell`, `ReceiveRelayCell`, `OpenStream`, `ReadFromStream`, `WriteToStream`, `EndStream`
- **RELAY Protocol**: RELAY_BEGIN, RELAY_DATA, RELAY_END, RELAY_CONNECTED handling
- **Bidirectional Relay**: Full duplex data relay between SOCKS client and Tor circuit
- **Encryption**: Per-hop AES-CTR encryption/decryption with SHA-1 digests
- **Flow Control**: Package/deliver window tracking with SENDME cells
- **Stream Management**: Stream multiplexing, ID allocation, state tracking
- **Circuit Pool**: Integration with isolated and non-isolated circuits

### Files
- `pkg/circuit/circuit.go` - Circuit and relay cell operations
- `pkg/socks/socks.go` - SOCKS5 handler with stream relay
- `pkg/stream/manager.go` - Stream multiplexing
- `pkg/pool/circuit_pool.go` - Circuit pool management

## Testing

```bash
# Start go-tor client
./bin/tor-client

# Test SOCKS5 proxy
curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:9050 https://check.torproject.org
```

## Recent Updates

**October 2025**: Fixed circuit pool logic to support both isolated and non-isolated circuits. The SOCKS5 handler now correctly uses `circuitPool.Get()` for default (non-isolated) connections and `circuitPool.GetWithIsolation()` when isolation is configured.

## 3. Security Findings

### 3.1 Critical Vulnerabilities

**None identified.**

### 3.2 High-Priority Security Concerns

#### FINDING H-001: Race Condition in SOCKS5 Test Shutdown

**Severity**: High  
**Confidence**: High  
**CWE**: CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization)  
**Location**: `pkg/socks/socks_test.go:416-419`

**Description**:
Race detector identified concurrent read/write access to TCP address structure during test shutdown with active connections.

**Technical Details**:
```
WARNING: DATA RACE
Read at 0x00c00018ed38 by goroutine 49:
  net.(*TCPAddr).String()
  pkg/socks/socks_test.go:419

Previous write at 0x00c00018ed38 by goroutine 50:
  net.sockaddrToTCP()
  pkg/socks/socks.go:85 (via ListenAndServe)
```

**Exploitation Scenario**:
While this is test code, it indicates potential race conditions in production code when handling concurrent connections during graceful shutdown.

**Impact**:
- Test code: Unreliable test results
- Production risk: Potential panic or connection handling issues during high-load shutdown

**Remediation**:
1. Synchronize access to listener address in tests
2. Review production shutdown logic for similar patterns
3. Add proper mutex protection for shared state
4. Ensure address is captured before server goroutine starts

**Estimated Fix Time**: 4-8 hours

---

#### FINDING H-002: Integer Overflow in Timestamp Conversion

**Severity**: High  
**Confidence**: Medium  
**CWE**: CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)  
**Location**: `pkg/onion/onion.go:690`

**Description**:
Unsafe conversion from signed `int64` (Unix timestamp) to unsigned `uint64` without overflow checking.

**Technical Details**:
```go
RevisionCounter: uint64(time.Now().Unix()),  // Line 690
```

**Exploitation Scenario**:
1. System time set to negative value (pre-1970 or malicious)
2. Negative int64 converted to large uint64
3. Descriptor rotation logic breaks
4. Potential descriptor ID collision or validation bypass

**Impact**:
- Descriptor rotation may fail
- Potential service discovery issues
- Edge case handling for time-based operations

**Remediation**:
```go
// Use safe conversion from pkg/security
timestamp := time.Now().Unix()
revisionCounter, err := safeInt64ToUint64(timestamp)
if err != nil {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid timestamp: %w", err)
}
descriptor := &OnionServiceDescriptor{
    DescriptorID:    descriptorID,
    RevisionCounter: revisionCounter,
    CreatedAt:       time.Now(),
}
```

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-4 hours

---

### 3.3 Medium-Priority Security Issues

#### FINDING M-001: SHA1 Usage (Required by Tor Specification)

**Severity**: Medium (False Positive)  
**Confidence**: High  
**CWE**: CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash)  
**Locations**: 
- `pkg/crypto/crypto.go:46` (SHA1Hash)
- `pkg/crypto/crypto.go:109` (RSA-OAEP with SHA1)
- `pkg/crypto/crypto.go:118` (RSA decrypt with SHA1)
- `pkg/crypto/crypto.go:132` (DigestWriter with SHA1)

**Description**:
Security scanner (gosec) flagged SHA1 usage as weak cryptographic primitive.

**Analysis**:
This is a **false positive** - SHA1 is **required** by Tor specifications:
- tor-spec.txt mandates SHA1 for specific protocol operations
- RSA-OAEP with SHA1 is specified for hybrid encryption
- Legacy relay compatibility requires SHA1 support

**Justification**:
- Not used for collision-resistant purposes
- Required for Tor protocol compatibility
- Cannot be replaced without breaking protocol
- SHA256 used for modern operations where allowed

**Remediation**:
```go
// Add security annotation to suppress false positive
// #nosec G401 - SHA1 required by Tor specification (tor-spec.txt)
func SHA1Hash(data []byte) []byte {
    h := sha1.Sum(data)
    return h[:]
}
```

**Action**: Document and suppress warnings with justification

---

#### FINDING M-002: Path Traversal Risk in Config Loader

**Severity**: Medium  
**Confidence**: Medium  
**CWE**: CWE-22 (Path Traversal)  
**Location**: `pkg/config/loader.go:226`

**Description**:
File creation using user-supplied path without validation.

**Technical Details**:
```go
file, err := os.Create(path)  // Line 226
```

**Exploitation Scenario**:
1. Attacker provides path like `../../etc/passwd`
2. Config loader creates/overwrites arbitrary files
3. System compromise or denial of service

**Current Mitigations**:
- Config loader used internally, not exposed to network
- Typically run with limited privileges

**Remediation**:
```go
import (
    "path/filepath"
    "strings"
)

func saveConfig(path string) error {
    // Validate path
    cleanPath := filepath.Clean(path)
    if strings.Contains(cleanPath, "..") {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid path: directory traversal detected")
    }
    
    // Ensure within allowed directory
    if !strings.HasPrefix(cleanPath, allowedConfigDir) {
        return fmt.Errorf("path outside allowed directory")
    }
    
    file, err := os.Create(cleanPath)
    // ...
}
```

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-4 hours

---

#### FINDING M-003: Integer Overflow in Backoff Calculation

**Severity**: Medium  
**Confidence**: Medium  
**CWE**: CWE-190 (Integer Overflow)  
**Location**: `examples/errors-demo/main.go:113`

**Description**:
Bit shift operation without bounds checking could cause overflow.

**Technical Details**:
```go
backoff := time.Duration(1<<uint(i)) * time.Second  // Line 113
```

**Exploitation Scenario**:
- Loop iteration `i >= 63` causes undefined behavior
- Backoff time becomes unpredictable
- Could result in extremely long or negative durations

**Impact**:
- Demo code only (not production)
- Could mislead developers copying pattern

**Remediation**:
```go
// Cap maximum backoff
maxBackoffPower := 10 // Max 1024 seconds (~17 minutes)
backoffPower := uint(i)
if backoffPower > uint(maxBackoffPower) {
    backoffPower = uint(maxBackoffPower)
}
backoff := time.Duration(1<<backoffPower) * time.Second
```

**Estimated Fix Time**: 1-2 hours

---

#### FINDING M-004: Test Coverage Gaps

**Severity**: Medium  
**Confidence**: High  
**Locations**:
- `pkg/client`: 21.0% coverage
- `pkg/protocol`: 9.8% coverage
- `pkg/connection`: 61.5% coverage

**Description**:
Critical packages have insufficient test coverage, potentially hiding bugs.

**Analysis**:
- `pkg/client`: Integration-level code, harder to unit test
- `pkg/protocol`: Low-level protocol handling needs more tests
- `pkg/connection`: Moderate coverage acceptable for network code

**Impact**:
- Untested code paths may contain bugs
- Regressions harder to catch
- Reduced confidence in refactoring

**Remediation**:
1. Add integration tests for `pkg/client`
2. Add protocol parsing tests for `pkg/protocol`
3. Add connection state machine tests
4. Target: >70% coverage for all packages

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-3 weeks

---

### 3.4 Low-Priority Issues

#### FINDING L-001: Test Race Condition (Benign)

**Location**: `pkg/socks/socks_test.go` (listener address access)  
**Impact**: Low - test code only, no production impact  
**Action**: Fix during test refactoring

---
